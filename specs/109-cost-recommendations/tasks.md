# Tasks: Cost Recommendations Command Enhancement

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/109-cost-recommendations/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md
**GitHub Issue**: #216

**Tests**: Per Constitution Principle II (Test-Driven Development), tests are MANDATORY and must be written BEFORE implementation. All code changes must maintain minimum 80% test coverage (95% for critical paths).

**Completeness**: Per Constitution Principle VI (Implementation Completeness), all tasks MUST be fully implemented. Stub functions, placeholders, and TODO comments are strictly forbidden.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## User Story Summary

| Story | Priority | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| US1 | P1 | Quick Overview of Recommendations (summary mode, top 5) |
| US2 | P2 | View All Recommendations in Detail (--verbose flag) |
| US3 | P2 | Filter Recommendations by Action Type (existing, verify) |
| US4 | P3 | Interactive Exploration (Bubble Tea TUI) |
| US5 | P2 | Machine-Readable Output for Automation (JSON enhancement) |
| US6 | P4 | View Loading Progress (spinner during queries) |

## Phase 1: Setup

**Purpose**: Verify existing infrastructure and prepare for modifications

- [ ] T001 Verify existing `internal/cli/cost_recommendations.go` has required base functionality
- [ ] T002 Verify existing `internal/tui/` package has required components (LoadingState, styles, table)
- [ ] T003 [P] Create test fixtures for recommendations in `test/fixtures/recommendations/`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: TUI model and view files must exist before US4 and US6 can be implemented

### Tests for Foundational Components (MANDATORY - TDD Required) ⚠️

- [ ] T004 [P] Create unit tests for RecommendationsSummary in `internal/tui/recommendations_model_test.go`
- [ ] T005 [P] Create unit tests for RecommendationRow in `internal/tui/recommendations_view_test.go`

### Implementation for Foundational Components

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - creates shared TUI components
- **User Stories (Phases 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (P1): Can start immediately after Foundational
  - US2 (P2): Can run parallel to US1 (different functionality)
  - US3 (P2): Depends on US1 (needs summary calculation logic)
  - US5 (P2): Can run parallel to US1, US2 (different output path)
  - US4 (P3): Depends on Foundational TUI components
  - US6 (P4): Depends on US4 (needs TUI model)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

```text
Foundational ──┬──> US1 (P1) ──> US3 (P2)
               │
               ├──> US2 (P2)
               │
               ├──> US5 (P2)
               │
               └──> US4 (P3) ──> US6 (P4)
```

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Implementation tasks in dependency order
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T004-T010 all [P] - can run in parallel

**User Stories**: After Foundational:

- US1, US2, US5 can run in parallel (different code paths)
- US4 can run parallel to US1, US2, US3, US5 (different files)

**Within US4**: T039-T043 and T052-T054 all [P] - can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 4

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 4 together:
Task: "Unit test for RecommendationsViewModel state transitions"
Task: "Unit test for keyboard handlers"
Task: "Unit test for filter logic"
Task: "Unit test for table rendering"
Task: "Unit test for detail view rendering"

# Launch parallelizable view implementations together:
Task: "Create NewRecommendationsTable()"
Task: "Create RenderRecommendationsSummaryStyled()"
Task: "Create RenderRecommendationDetail()"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run `pulumicost cost recommendations --pulumi-json plan.json` - should show summary + top 5
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. **MVP**: Setup + Foundational + US1 → Summary mode works
2. **+US2**: Add verbose mode → Users can see all recommendations
3. **+US3**: Verify filtering → Users can filter by action type
4. **+US5**: Enhance JSON → CI/CD integration ready
5. **+US4**: Add TUI → Interactive exploration
6. **+US6**: Add spinner → Polish complete

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: US1 (P1) → US3 (P2)
   - Developer B: US2 (P2) → US5 (P2)
   - Developer C: US4 (P3) → US6 (P4)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Run `make lint` and `make test` after each phase
- Commit after each task or logical group
