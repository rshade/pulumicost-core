# Tasks: Pulumi Analyzer Plugin Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-analyzer-plugin/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Per Constitution Principle II (Test-Driven Development), tests are MANDATORY
and must be written BEFORE implementation. All code changes must maintain minimum 80%
test coverage (95% for critical paths).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation
and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Go monorepo**: `internal/` packages at repository root
- **Tests**: Co-located with source files as `*_test.go`
- **Integration tests**: `test/integration/`
- **Fixtures**: `test/fixtures/analyzer/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and dependency setup

- [ ] T001 Add Pulumi SDK dependency `github.com/pulumi/pulumi/sdk/v3` to go.mod
- [ ] T002 [P] Create `internal/analyzer/` package directory structure
- [ ] T003 [P] Create `internal/analyzer/doc.go` with package documentation
- [ ] T004 [P] Create `test/fixtures/analyzer/` directory for test data
- [ ] T005 Run `go mod tidy` and verify dependencies resolve

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story

**CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T006 Extend `internal/config/config.go` with `AnalyzerConfig` struct

- [ ] T010 Create `test/fixtures/analyzer/sample-stack.json` with mock resources
- [ ] T011 Create `test/fixtures/analyzer/expected-diagnostics.json` for test validation

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Automatic Cost Estimation in Preview (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Display estimated cost impact directly within `pulumi preview` output

**Independent Test**: Run `pulumi preview` on a project with the analyzer configured
and verify that cost estimates appear in the standard output.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Plugin Installation & Handshake (Priority: P1)

- [ ] T049 [US2] Verify all US2 tests pass with `go test ./internal/cli/... ./internal/analyzer/...`

**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 complete - plugin starts, handshakes, and serves gRPC

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Robust Error Handling (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Preview completes successfully even if cost estimation fails

**Independent Test**: Simulate a pricing API failure and ensure `pulumi preview`
still finishes with warnings.

- [ ] T064 Run full test suite: `make test`
- [ ] T065 Run linting: `make lint`
- [ ] T065.5 Run `govulncheck ./...` to verify no high/critical vulnerabilities (stdlib vulns noted, need Go 1.25.5)
- [ ] T066 Verify coverage meets 80% threshold for analyzer package (achieved 92.7%)
- [ ] T066.5 Verify 80% docstring coverage for `internal/analyzer` package (all exported symbols documented)

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T069 [P] Update CLI help text for `analyzer serve` command
- [ ] T070 Run quickstart.md validation steps
- [ ] T071 Final `make lint && make test` verification
- [ ] T072 Verify binary builds on all target platforms (linux, darwin, windows)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
  - Can run in parallel with US1 if desired
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 and US2 (builds on their implementations)
- **Integration (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories complete
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on Integration phase

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Core cost estimation logic - no dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Plugin handshake - can be developed in parallel with US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Error handling - depends on US1/US2 base implementations

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Mapper functions before server methods
- Server methods before CLI commands
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:

- T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel

**Phase 3 (US1 Tests)**:

- T012-T019 can all run in parallel (different test functions)

**Phase 3 (US1 Implementation)**:

- T021-T028 can all run in parallel (different functions)

**Phase 4 (US2 Tests)**:

- T035-T038 can run in parallel

**Phase 5 (US3)**:

- T050-T054 tests can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all mapper tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for MapResource in internal/analyzer/mapper_test.go"
Task: "Unit test for MapResources in internal/analyzer/mapper_test.go"
Task: "Unit test for extractResourceID in internal/analyzer/mapper_test.go"
Task: "Unit test for extractProvider in internal/analyzer/mapper_test.go"
Task: "Unit test for structToMap in internal/analyzer/mapper_test.go"

# Launch all diagnostics tests together:
Task: "Unit test for CostToDiagnostic in internal/analyzer/diagnostics_test.go"
Task: "Unit test for StackSummaryDiagnostic in internal/analyzer/diagnostics_test.go"
Task: "Unit test for formatCostMessage in internal/analyzer/diagnostics_test.go"

# Launch all mapper implementations together:
Task: "Implement MapResource function in internal/analyzer/mapper.go"
Task: "Implement MapResources function in internal/analyzer/mapper.go"
Task: "Implement extractResourceID function in internal/analyzer/mapper.go"
Task: "Implement extractProvider function in internal/analyzer/mapper.go"
Task: "Implement structToMap function in internal/analyzer/mapper.go"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (core cost estimation)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (plugin handshake)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test with actual `pulumi preview`
6. Deploy/demo if ready - MVP complete!

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Costs display in diagnostics (partial MVP)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Full `pulumi preview` integration (MVP!)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Robust error handling
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (mapper, diagnostics, AnalyzeStack)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (handshake, CLI, server startup)
3. After US1+US2: Developer A+B: User Story 3 (error handling)
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **CRITICAL**: stdout is reserved for port handshake only - all logs to stderr
- **TDD Required**: Tests written first per Constitution Principle II
