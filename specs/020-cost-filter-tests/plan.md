# Implementation Plan: Integration Tests for --filter Flag

**Branch**: `020-cost-filter-tests` | **Date**: Tue Dec 16 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/020-cost-filter-tests/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement comprehensive integration tests for the `--filter` flag across `cost projected` and `cost actual` commands. Tests will validate filtering by resource type, provider, and tags using actual exported Pulumi plan fixtures with 10-20 resources. The implementation will extend the existing integration test infrastructure in `test/integration/cli/` to ensure the filter functionality works correctly across all output formats and handles edge cases gracefully.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Go 1.25.5 (from AGENTS.md and go.mod)
**Primary Dependencies**: Existing CLI infrastructure (`internal/cli/`, `internal/engine/`), test helpers (`test/integration/helpers/`)
**Storage**: N/A (CLI tool processing JSON files)
**Testing**: Go testing framework with testify assertions (existing pattern in test/integration/cli/)
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows - constitution requirement)
**Project Type**: CLI tool (single binary)
**Performance Goals**: Test suite execution time not to increase by more than 10 seconds (SC-003)
**Constraints**: Filter operations should not degrade significantly compared to unfiltered queries (NFR-001); case-sensitive filtering
**Scale/Scope**: 10-20 resources per test plan fixture

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

Verify compliance with PulumiCost Core Constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`):

- [x] **Plugin-First Architecture**: This is orchestration logic testing existing CLI/engine functionality - no plugin changes required
- [x] **Test-Driven Development**: Tests are the primary deliverable, implementing missing integration test coverage for existing functionality (80% minimum coverage targeted)
- [x] **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: CLI tool runs on Linux, macOS, Windows - existing cross-platform support maintained
- [x] **Documentation as Code**: Test implementation includes documentation through code comments and test naming (no separate docs needed for internal tests)
- [x] **Protocol Stability**: No protocol changes - testing existing functionality
- [x] **Quality Gates**: Implementation will follow `make lint` and `make test` requirements (SC-002, linting protocol)
- [x] **Multi-Repo Coordination**: No cross-repo dependencies - all work within pulumicost-core

**Violations Requiring Justification**: (Fill only if any principle is violated)
