# Research & Technical Decisions

**Feature**: Create shared TUI package with Bubble Tea/Lip Gloss components
**Date**: Tue Dec 09 2025
**Researcher**: opencode

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Bubble Tea & Lip Gloss Best Practices

**Decision**: Use Bubble Tea v1.2.4 and Lip Gloss v1.0.0 as specified in dependencies

**Rationale**:

- Bubble Tea provides excellent model-view-update architecture for CLI TUIs
- Lip Gloss offers consistent styling with ANSI color support
- Versions chosen for stability and compatibility with Go 1.25.5
- Charm libraries are actively maintained and widely adopted in Go CLI ecosystem

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Cobra + color libraries: Rejected due to lack of interactive TUI capabilities
- Termui: Rejected as unmaintained, Bubble Tea is the modern successor
- Raw ANSI escape codes: Rejected for complexity and cross-platform issues

### 2. TTY Detection & Fallback Strategy

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive TTY detection with NO_COLOR, CI, and TERM environment support

**Rationale**:

- NO_COLOR standard ensures accessibility compliance
- CI environments need styled but non-interactive output
- TERM=dumb detection prevents ANSI issues in basic terminals
- golang.org/x/term provides reliable cross-platform TTY detection

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Simple os.Stdout detection: Insufficient for CI/scripting scenarios
- No fallbacks: Would break in non-TTY environments

### 3. Color Scheme Design

**Decision**: Use ANSI 256-color palette with semantic color names

**Rationale**:

- 256 colors provide good compatibility across terminals
- Semantic naming (ColorOK, ColorWarning) improves maintainability
- Hex comments aid in color selection and documentation

**Alternatives Considered**:

- True color (24-bit): Rejected for broader terminal compatibility
- Named colors only: Rejected for precise control needed

### 4. Component Architecture

**Decision**: Pure functions with configuration structs for reusable components

**Rationale**:

- ProgressBar struct allows customization while maintaining defaults
- Pure functions enable easy testing and composition
- No global state prevents testing and concurrency issues

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Global styling singleton: Rejected for testability concerns
- Builder pattern: Overkill for simple components

### 5. Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Table-driven unit tests with 80% minimum coverage (95% for critical paths)

**Rationale**:

- Table-driven tests excel at testing multiple input combinations
- Go's testing framework supports this pattern natively
- High coverage ensures reliability for shared components

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Integration tests only: Insufficient for component validation
- Property-based testing: May be added later but unit tests sufficient initially

## Technical Findings

### Bubble Tea Integration Patterns

- Use tea.Model for interactive components
- tea.Cmd for asynchronous operations
- tea.Msg for state updates
- Lip Gloss for all styling to ensure consistency

### Cross-Platform Considerations

- ANSI colors work on all supported platforms
- TTY detection handles Windows cmd/powershell differences
- No platform-specific code needed for basic TUI

### Performance Characteristics

- Lip Gloss rendering is fast (<1ms for typical outputs)
- Bubble Tea model updates are efficient
- Memory usage minimal for CLI components

## Resolved Technical Context Items

All items in Technical Context are now fully specified with no remaining NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers.

## Recommendations

1. **Version Pinning**: Keep dependencies at specified versions for stability
2. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit tests before integration
3. **Documentation**: Include usage examples in code comments
4. **CI Integration**: Ensure tests run in CI with various terminal configurations
