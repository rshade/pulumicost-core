# AI Agent Instruction Files

This repository contains AI agent instruction files that provide guidance for different AI assistants working with the codebase.

## Supported Files:

- **CLAUDE.md**: Instructions for Claude Code (claude.ai/code)
- **GEMINI.md**: Instructions for Gemini AI assistants
- **AGENTS.md**: General agent instructions for various AI tools

## Usage Guidelines:

- **Read these files** when working with AI assistants
- **Reference the appropriate file** based on the AI tool being used
- **Follow the instructions** provided in these files
- **Keep instructions updated** as the codebase evolves

## File Purposes:

- **CLAUDE.md**: Comprehensive development guidelines, build commands, architecture overview, testing requirements
- **GEMINI.md**: Concise development guidelines, active technologies, workflow restrictions
- **AGENTS.md**: Repository guidelines, coding standards, project structure, development commands

## Maintenance Requirements:

- **Update regularly** as codebase changes
- **Keep version information current** (Go versions, dependencies)
- **Document new patterns** and conventions
- **Include new tools** and technologies
- **Update build/test commands** as they change

## Integration with Copilot:

- These files are automatically read by GitHub Copilot
- Use them as reference for consistent development practices
- Follow the coding standards and patterns documented
- Reference the build and testing instructions provided

## When to Update:

- New dependencies are added
- Build processes change
- Coding standards evolve
- New tools or technologies are introduced
- Project structure changes
- Testing requirements change

## Critical Instructions:

- **Never commit changes** without user approval (CLAUDE.md restriction)
- **Always run tests and linting** before completion
- **Follow Go 1.25.5+ standards** and best practices
- **Maintain high test coverage** (80%+ target)
