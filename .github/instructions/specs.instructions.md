# Specs Directory Instructions

This directory contains specification files and feature plans that are not part of the main codebase. These files are primarily for project management and planning purposes.

## Guidelines for this directory:

- **Do not modify** existing spec files unless explicitly instructed
- **Do not add** new spec files without approval
- **Do not reference** spec files in code or documentation
- **Do not commit** changes to spec files unless they are part of a planned feature implementation

## Purpose:

- Feature planning and requirements gathering
- Cross-repository coordination
- Project milestone tracking
- Historical record of feature decisions

## When working with specs:

- Read-only access for understanding project context
- Use information from specs to inform code decisions
- Do not treat specs as authoritative documentation
- Specs may contain outdated or superseded information
