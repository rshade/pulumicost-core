## Contribution Types

### New Features (Requires SpecKit)

New features, capabilities, and architectural changes **must** use
[SpecKit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) for specification-driven
development. This ensures features are well-planned, documented, and testable.

### Minor Bug Fixes (SpecKit Optional)

Minor bug fixes and small improvements **do not require** SpecKit. You may
submit a pull request directly.

**What qualifies as a minor bug fix:**

- Typo corrections in code or documentation
- Small logic fixes that don't change APIs
- Documentation corrections or clarifications
- Dependency updates for security patches
- Test improvements and additional test coverage
- Performance optimizations without API changes

**What requires SpecKit:**

- New CLI commands or flags
- New features or capabilities
- API changes or new endpoints
- Architectural modifications
- Changes affecting the plugin protocol
- New integrations or data sources

make validate   # Module and vet checks pass
```

## Feature Development with SpecKit

New features **must** follow specification-driven development using
[SpecKit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit). This workflow ensures features
are properly designed before implementation.

### Why SpecKit?

- **Better planning**: Features are fully specified before coding begins
- **Clearer requirements**: User stories and acceptance criteria defined upfront
- **Consistent quality**: Follows project constitution and quality gates
- **Easier review**: Reviewers understand the intent and scope

### Installing SpecKit

```bash
# Install with uv (recommended)
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git

# Or install with pipx
pipx install git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

### SpecKit Workflow

1. **Create specification** - Define what you're building:

   ```text
   /speckit.specify [your feature description]
   ```

2. **Clarify ambiguities** - Resolve underspecified areas (recommended):

   ```text
   /speckit.clarify
   ```

   This asks targeted questions to fill gaps in your spec before planning.

3. **Plan implementation** - Design the technical approach:

   ```text
   /speckit.plan
   ```

4. **Generate tasks** - Break down into actionable items:

   ```text
   /speckit.tasks
   ```

5. **Analyze consistency** - Validate artifacts before implementation:

   ```text
   /speckit.analyze
   ```

   This performs read-only analysis across spec, plan, and tasks to catch
   inconsistencies, gaps, and constitution violations.

6. **Implement** - Build the feature:

   ```text
   /speckit.implement
   ```

### Project Specifications Directory

All specifications, plans, and templates are stored in the `.specify/` directory:

```text
.specify/
├── memory/
│   └── constitution.md    # Project principles and quality gates
├── scripts/               # Helper scripts for SpecKit workflows
│   └── bash/
│       ├── check-prerequisites.sh
│       ├── create-new-feature.sh
│       └── setup-plan.sh
└── templates/             # Templates for specs, plans, tasks
    ├── spec-template.md
    ├── plan-template.md
    ├── tasks-template.md
    └── checklist-template.md
```

**Important**: All feature work must follow these core principles and quality gates:

1. **Statelessness**: Core must remain stateless - no persistent storage in-core
2. **Plugin Protocol First**: Changes to functionality require spec updates in finfocus-spec
3. **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% overall, 95% for critical paths
4. **Documentation**: Exported symbols require docstrings
5. **Code Quality**: Must pass golangci-lint, go vet, and gofmt checks

## Minor Bug Fixes

For minor bug fixes that don't require SpecKit:

1. **Create a branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/brief-description main
   ```

2. **Make your changes** and write tests

3. **Run quality checks:**

   ```bash
   make test    # Must pass
   make lint    # Must pass
   ```

4. **Submit a pull request** with:
   - Clear description of the bug
   - Explanation of the fix
   - Tests demonstrating the fix works

## Quality Requirements

All contributions must meet these quality gates, which are enforced by CI:

### Code Quality

- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% overall, 95% for critical paths
- **Linting**: `golangci-lint` must pass with zero errors
- **Security**: `govulncheck` must report no high/critical vulnerabilities
- **Formatting**: All Go code must be formatted with `gofmt`
- **Documentation**: Minimum 80% docstring coverage for exported symbols

### Pre-Submission Checklist

**Always run these commands before submitting:**

```bash
make lint      # Must pass with no errors
make test      # All tests must pass
make validate  # Module and vet checks must pass
```

### Test Requirements

For detailed testing instructions, see the [Testing Guide](../testing/guide.md).

- Write tests before implementation (TDD approach)
- Include tests for all new code paths
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Run tests with race detector: `make test-race`

### Running Fuzz Tests

FinFocus uses Go's native fuzzing (Go 1.25+) to test parser resilience:

```bash
# Run JSON parser fuzz test (30 seconds)
go test -fuzz=FuzzJSON$ -fuzztime=30s ./internal/ingest

# Run YAML parser fuzz test (30 seconds)
go test -fuzz=FuzzYAML$ -fuzztime=30s ./internal/spec

# Run all fuzz tests in a package
go test -fuzz=. -fuzztime=30s ./internal/ingest
```

**Fuzz test locations:**

| Package           | Test Function         | Target               |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| `internal/ingest` | `FuzzJSON`            | JSON parser          |
| `internal/ingest` | `FuzzPulumiPlanParse` | Full plan parsing    |
| `internal/spec`   | `FuzzYAML`            | YAML spec parsing    |
| `internal/spec`   | `FuzzSpecFilename`    | Spec filename parser |

**Seed corpus:**

Fuzz tests use seed corpora in `testdata/fuzz/` directories. Add new
interesting inputs discovered during fuzzing to these directories.

**CI integration:**

- PRs run 30-second fuzz smoke tests
- Nightly builds run 6-hour deep fuzzing sessions

### Running Benchmarks

FinFocus includes performance benchmarks for scalability testing:

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./test/benchmarks/...

# Run specific scale benchmarks
go test -bench=BenchmarkScale -benchmem ./test/benchmarks/...

# Run with specific iteration count
go test -bench=BenchmarkScale1K -benchtime=10x -benchmem ./test/benchmarks/...
```

**Available benchmarks:**

| Benchmark                    | Description             | Target   |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
| `BenchmarkScale1K`           | 1,000 resources         | < 1s     |
| `BenchmarkScale10K`          | 10,000 resources        | < 30s    |
| `BenchmarkScale100K`         | 100,000 resources       | < 5min   |
| `BenchmarkDeeplyNested`      | Deep nesting complexity | < 1s     |
| `BenchmarkJSONParsing`       | JSON parsing at scale   | Baseline |
| `BenchmarkGeneratorOverhead` | Generator overhead      | Baseline |

**Benchmark guidelines:**

- Run benchmarks on a quiet system for consistent results
- Use `-benchtime=10x` for quick checks, `-benchtime=1m` for accurate results
- Compare results between commits to detect performance regressions
- CI runs smoke benchmarks (1x) on every PR

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

2. **Run all quality checks:**

   ```bash
   make test
   make lint
   make validate
   ```

3. **Push and create PR:**

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

4. **Fill in PR template** with:
   - Description of changes
   - Type of change (feature, fix, docs, etc.)
   - Testing performed
   - Related issues

### CI Checks

All pull requests must pass:

- Go Tests with race detection
- Code Coverage (minimum threshold)
- golangci-lint
- Security scanning (govulncheck)
- Documentation validation
- Cross-platform builds (Linux, macOS, Windows)

### Automated Nightly Failure Analysis

To assist with debugging, the project employs an automated nightly failure
analysis workflow:

- **Trigger**: When a nightly build fails, an issue is created with the
  `nightly-failure` label.
- **Analysis**: A workflow automatically runs to fetch logs, analyze them
  using OpenCode, and post a triage report as a comment.
- **Goal**: Provide immediate root cause hypothesis and suggested fixes to
  reduce manual investigation time.

## Project Architecture

FinFocus operates as a three-repository ecosystem:

| Repository                | Purpose                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| [finfocus][core]     | CLI tool, plugin host, orchestration engine |
| [finfocus-spec][spec]     | Protocol buffer definitions, SDK generation |
| [finfocus-plugin][plugin] | Plugin implementations (Kubecost, Vantage)  |

[core]: https://github.com/rshade/finfocus
[spec]: https://github.com/rshade/finfocus-spec
[plugin]: https://github.com/rshade/finfocus-plugin

Cross-repository changes require coordination. All changes to the plugin protocol
must be proposed in the finfocus-spec repository first, then synchronized to
core and plugin implementations.
