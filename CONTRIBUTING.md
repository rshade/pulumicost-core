## Making Changes

### Creating a Branch

```bash
# Fetch latest changes
git fetch upstream

# Create feature branch from main
git checkout -b feature/my-feature upstream/main
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation only
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Test additions/improvements

### Code Style

#### Go Code

- Follow standard Go conventions ([Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go))
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Ensure `golangci-lint` passes: `make lint`
- Write clear variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and complex logic

#### Markdown

- Follow Google style guide for markdown formatting
- Use `make docs-lint` to validate
- Line length: 120 characters (soft limit for prose)
- Use clear headings and structure

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feature: Add support for cost filtering by tags

This allows users to filter cost results by resource tags,
enabling cost allocation by team or environment.

- Add tag filtering to engine
- Add --filter flag to CLI
- Update tests and documentation

Closes #123
```

**Format:**
- First line: type: Short description (50 chars max)
- Blank line
- Body: Detailed explanation (wrapped at 72 chars)
- Blank line
- References: Link to related issues/PRs

**Types:**
- `feature` - New functionality
- `fix` - Bug fixes
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `test` - Test additions/changes
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `perf` - Performance improvements
- `chore` - Build, dependencies, etc.

### Testing Your Changes

```bash
# Run tests for your changes
make test

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests in specific package
go test -v ./internal/engine/...

# Run specific test
go test -run TestCostCalculation ./...
```

All tests must pass before submitting a PR.

---

## Testing

### Writing Tests

Place tests in `*_test.go` files alongside the code being tested.

```go
// Example test
func TestMyFeature(t *testing.T) {
    // Arrange
    input := "test input"

    // Act
    result := MyFunction(input)

    // Assert
    if result != "expected" {
        t.Errorf("Expected 'expected', got '%s'", result)
    }
}
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for >80% coverage in new code
- Run `make test` to check current coverage
- Focus on critical paths and error cases

---

## Documentation

### Where Documentation Lives

- **Code-focused docs**: `docs/` directory
- **API docs**: Protocol buffer comments in `internal/proto/`
- **Package docs**: `CLAUDE.md` files in package directories
- **Contributing**: This file and `docs/support/contributing.md`

### Documentation Standards

- All public functions should have godoc comments
- Update `docs/` when adding user-facing features
- Update `docs/reference/` for CLI/API changes
- Link to relevant documentation in code comments

### Documentation Commands

```bash
# Lint documentation
make docs-lint

# Build documentation site
make docs-build

# Serve locally for preview
make docs-serve

# Validate documentation
make docs-validate
```

### Adding a New Guide

1. Create file in appropriate `docs/` subdirectory
2. Add frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   layout: default
   title: My Guide Title
   description: Brief description for search
   ---
   ```
3. Write content following [Google style guide](https://developers.google.com/style)
4. Run `make docs-lint` to validate
5. Submit PR with documentation changes
